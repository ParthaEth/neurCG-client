                <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                <p>If your personal data are processed, then you are a data subject within the language of GDPR, and you have the following rights vis-à-vis the controller:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right to Information:</strong> <br />
                    According to Art. 15 GDPR, you have a right to information. Specifically, this means you have the right to request confirmation from the data controller as to whether we process personal data pertaining to you. If this is the case, you also have the right to obtain information about these personal data, and about the information set forth in Art. 15 (1) GDPR. This includes, for instance, information about the purposes for processing, about the categories of personal data processed, and about the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed (Art. 15 (1) lit. a), b) and c) GDPR).</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong><br />
                    According to Art. 16 GDPR, you have a right to rectification. What this means specifically is that you have the right to request immediate rectification of incorrect personal data about you as well as completion of incomplete personal data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong><br />
                    Art. 17 GDPR grants you a right to erasure of data about you (also known as the “right to be forgotten”). In other words, you have the right to request that we erase personal data relating to you immediately, and we have an obligation to erase personal data at once if one of the reasons set forth in Art. 17 (1) GDPR applies. This may be the case, for example, if personal data are no longer needed to fulfil the purposes for which they were collected or were otherwise processed (Art. 17 (1) lit. a) GDPR).</li>
                     <li>If we have made the personal data public and are obliged to erase them, we are also under an obligation, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, to take reasonable steps, including technical ones, to inform other controllers responsible for processing these personal data that a data subject has requested that they erase all links to these personal data, together with any copies or replications thereof (Art. 17 (2) GDPR).</li>
                     <li>By way of exception, the right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) does not apply if processing of the data in question is required for the reasons set forth in Art. 17 (3) GDPR. This may be the case, for example, insofar as processing is required to meet a legal obligation, or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims (Art. 17 (3) lit. a) and e) GDPR).</li>
                     <li><strong>Right to demand processing restrictions</strong><br /> Under certain conditions, Art. 18 GDPR also guarantees your right to restriction of processing of these data. This means that you have the right to request that we restrict processing if one of the conditions listed in Art. 18 (1) GDPR is met. This may be the case, for example, if you dispute the accuracy of personal data about you. In this case, processing is restricted for a period sufficient to permit us to review the personal data for accuracy (Art. 18 (1) lit. a) GDPR). Restriction involves the marking of stored personal data with the goal of restricting their future processing (Art. 4 No. 3 GDPR). </li>
                        <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong><br />As a data subject, you also have a right to data portability in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR. This means that you generally have the right to receive the personal data about you that you have provided to us, presented in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and that you have the right to transmit these data to another data controller unimpeded by us, provided that the processing is based on consent issued pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a) or Art. 9 (2) lit. a) GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR, and provided that such processing is carried out with the aid of automated procedures (Art. 20 (1) GDPR).
In exercising your right to data portability, you always have the right to take steps to see to it that your personal data are transmitted directly by us to another data controller, provided that this is technically feasible (Art. 20 (2) GDPR).</li>
<li><strong>Right to object</strong><br />
Art. 21 GDPR guarantees your right to object. We expressly inform you, as a data subject, of your right to object not later than upon our first communication with you.

Please find more detailed information below:</li>
<li><strong>Right to object on grounds resulting from the situation specific to the data subject</strong><br />As a data subject, you have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing of personal data concerning you on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit e) or f) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions.

 

In the case of an objection for reasons stemming from your particular situation, we will no longer process the personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing and these grounds override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is in service of establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to object to direct marketing</strong><br />If personal data is processed to engage in direct advertising, you have the right to at any time object to the processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is affiliated with such direct advertising.

In the event that you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process the personal data concerned for these purposes</li>        
            <li><strong>Right to revoke consent</strong><br />If the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a) or Art. 9 (2) lit. a) GDPR, you as a data subject have the right to revoke your consent at any time pursuant to Art. 7 (3) GDPR. Revocation of consent will not affect the legality of processing undertaken on the basis of this consent prior to its revocation. We will bring this to your attention before you grant your consent.</li>
